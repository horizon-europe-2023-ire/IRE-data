# IRE-data

In this data repository we will share derived data for the coordination between workpackages. Each work package should in this ReadMe define where the original data of which they are sharing derivatives comes from with links to the relevant data repositories.

## Work Package 1 (WP1)

We are sharing derived data from the Cancer Imaging Archive. [The Cancer Imaging Archive](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/) shares most data freely available to browse, download, and use for commercial, scientific and educational purposes as outlined in the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). 

The original data we will be using to create derived data (meshes of the colon) will be:
- TCGA-COAD (25 samples): [https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/tcga-coad/](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/tcga-coad/)
- CT COLONOGRAPHY (825 samples): [https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/ct-colonography/](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/ct-colonography/)

The example-data we are sharing is from the CT COLONOGRAPHY dataset and the original data can be found here:
[https://nbia.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-search/?saved-cart=nbia-45361720442601460](https://nbia.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-search/?saved-cart=nbia-45361720442601460)
Additionally to the manual segmented colon in the example data, we share two instances of segmented intestine (small intestine included).

We provide both the compressed .mha and .ply files for each segmented colon.
